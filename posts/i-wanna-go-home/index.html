    <p>A poem I wrote the day of a poetry reading. I was afraid no one would show, so I thought it would be good to have something to fill the time. Then I ended it up using it as a way to peer-pressure a friend into also doing a reading.</p>

<p><strong>I Wanna Go Home</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;I wanna go home.&quot;
The feeling is bright,
    all-consuming,
    from nowhere,
    and immediately gone.
The dryer is buzzing,
    food is sizzling on the stove.

&quot;I am home...&quot;
(I say this softly to myself.)

Suddenly there's sunlight ---
    hot,
    yellow,
    burning
    sunlight.
Peas and tomatoes growing up a trellis.
A fox,
    some deer,
    and the sound of a bird I can't identify.
There's more time
    and longer days
    and peaceful evenings watching overgrown grass
    move like waves in the moonlight.

Then it's gone.
The dishwasher is humming
    and the dim kitchen light makes
    everything look artificial.

&quot;I wanna go home?&quot; I ask.
